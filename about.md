## What is Fireside?
Fireside Fiction Company started in 2012 as a Kickstarter-funded short-story magazine. We started out with the goals of finding and publishing great stories regardless of genre, and paying our writers well. Since Nov. 8, 2016, we have a third goal: resisting the global rise of fascism and far-right populism, starting with the current occupant of the White House.

## Fair pay for everyone
Fair pay is a big deal for us. We think creative people should be able to make a living from their work.

Fireside pays 12.5 cents per word, well above the 5 or 6 cents currently considered to be the minimum professional rate. For illustrations, we pay $400.

## Support Fireside

Running Fireside isn’t cheap. We’re working to wean ourselves from Kickstarter and to build up sustainable support.

Most of our revenue goes to the fair pay for our writers and artists. The rest of our money goes to site maintenance and other administrative costs.

If you’re been enjoying Fireside and like our mission of great storytelling and fair pay, please consider supporting us so we’re around for years to come.

## The Fireside Team

### [Brian White](https://talkwordy.com)—Editor & Publisher
Brian White has been a newspaper journalist for over a decade, largely as an editor. He spends a lot of time on Twitter as [@talkwordy](https://twitter.com/talkwordy), where you can generally find him yelling about clowns, hedgehogs, and bigots. He lives around Boston with his amazing wife and two cats that are generally also amazing, though murderous.

### [Elsa Sjunneson-Henry](https://feministsonar.com)—Assistant Editor
Elsa Sjunneson-Henry is a half-blind, half-deaf, half- Scandinavian writer and editor from Seattle, Washington. She’s got an MA in Women’s History, and she uses that to write about disability and media. She’s enough of a nerd that she ended up making games writing a large part of her freelance career. You can find her yelling about disability and fiction in many places on the internet, including [Feminist Sonar](https://feministsonar.com/), her blog on the intersection of disability issues, gender, sexuality, and media. She’s the author of [_A Place Out of Time_](http://www.firesidefiction.com/issue34/chapter/a-place-out-of-time/) and is also included in the [_Ghost in the Cogs_](http://amzn.to/2au3fe0) anthology. Reports indicate she’s been called a dragon more than once. Supposedly that’s a good thing. Currently, she lives in New Jersey with her delightfully quirky husband, a hound dog, and two cats who may hate her. You can find Elsa on Twitter [@snarkbat](https://twitter.com/snarkbat).

### [Pablo Defendini](https://twitter.com/pablod)—Design & Technology Director
Pablo Defendini is [a designer for hire](https://defendini.com), with a focus on editorial design for digital media. Occasionally he'll do some illustration and printmaking for his own amusement. He also gets really nerdy exploring new forms for [building digital comics out of HTML and CSS](https://digitalcomics.co/). He helped launch [Tor.com](https://tor.com/), before moving on to work for companies that sit in the overlap between publishing and technology, like [Open Road Media](https://openroadmedia.com/) and [O'Reilly](https://safaribooksonline.com/). Pablo was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, lives in New York City, and works with clients all over the world.

## Content Notes
Fireside Fiction Company provides content notes for books and stories to guide readers who may wish to seek out or avoid particular story elements. These content notes may contain spoilers.
Content notes are not the same as the ratings found on movies, TV shows, and video games. The intent is to help trauma survivors avoid being surprised by story elements that may trigger pain or emotional distress. So we don’t offer warnings about general violence, profanity, sex, or other things one sees in a movie rating.

We welcome suggestions for elements to include or exclude. You can email us at [books@firesidefiction.com](mailto:books@firesidefiction.com).

Here is a list of the elements we currently offer notes for:

- Alcohol Abuse

- Animal Abuse

- Child Abuse

- Emotional Abuse

- Gender-Bias Violence
