# Fireside Magazine
This is the source for Fireside Magazine. It runs on (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com], and is served off (Github Pages)[https://pages.github.com]. The idea is that, with a little bit of Markdown and Git knowledge, we can make Fireside production as simple as editing some plain text flies in a folder, and making a push to (the Fireside git repository)[https://github.com/firesidefiction].

## Updating Fireside Magazine
You can update the content on fireside magazine by editing the text files inside the `_posts` folder.

Text files are formatted using (Markdown)[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/], (a lightweight markup language)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown] with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

All posts need to include a piece of front matter written in YAML.

All Post filenames need to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title-of-the-post.md`

## Installation on your computer
You shouldn't have to do this, since Github takes care of running Jekyll once you commit. But if you ever want to run a local preview of the fireside site in your browser, here's how to do it:

Download Xcode CLI tools, for Ruby
install Jekyll
