Welcome to the private beta for the new Fireside Fiction website. If you're reading this, you've been given access so that you can help us kick the tires and generally make sure that everything is ship-shape before we launch on February 21. 

The new site is a much simpler design than the previous one. Instead of separating our stories into issues, each with its own mini homepage, we are reverting back to a classic blog-style, reverse-chronological 'river' of content on the homepage. The homepage river will display both the short stories and flash fic you've come to expect from Fireside, as well as the nonfiction and news content that we've been previously publishing on Medium. Fiction will always have pride of place on our homepage river, so our short stories and flash fic look different than our editorial content.

The top navigation of the site has been dramatically simplified, with only two links aside from the main homepage link: a link to our Books page, and a link to our About Us page.

The footer at the bottom of every page on the site includes our call to action block, which includes a button to become a backer on Patreon. Following that, we have a short slug and additional navigation. This navigation repeats the links to the Books and the About Us page from the top of the site, and includes additional, secondary links to an Authors page, a Values statement, and a direct link to the Submissions Guidelines section of the About Us page. Additionally, we have social media links, a sign up form for our newsletter, and a block for calling out our big money sponsors.

The Books page gathers up all of the novels and novellas that Fireside Books has published a date, and gives each book its own standalone page, where we can gather buy buttons, book descriptions, and reviews.

The About Us page compiles all of the information about Fireside Fiction Company into one place. This page is designed to be a one-stop-shop for anyone looking for any information about Fireside. The sidebar on the left-hand side of the page will serve as a table of contents for all of the material on this page, for easy access. This also means that each section has an anchor link, so it can be linked to directly using a simple URL scheme (for instance, firesidefiction.com/about/#submissions-guidelines). Currently, the sidebar is a little out of sync with the main content, since we are still working on finalizing the copy that will be on this page (for instance, you'll see that the submissions guidelines are completely missing—we are still in the process of revising those, but they will be ready by lunch on February 21).

The Authors page compiles a list of every single author that has ever contributed to Fireside, along with links to their stories on the site. It should serve as an easy place to look for work by your favorite authors. Currently it only lists authors for the first issue, but as we migrate old content onto the new site, this page will grow.

The Values page lists the six core foundational values for Fireside Fiction Company. These were workshopped by Brian, Elsa, and me, with input from a handful of trusted advisors. This will serve as a public statement of intent for Fireside, as well as our guiding light going forward. As you'll see when you read them, they allude to a few things that we haven't quite made public yet, so we might edit them before launch, while we get our ducks in a row in order to roll out everything we want to roll out over the course of the next few months.

We are eagerly looking forward to your feedback on the site as a whole. But as you look through the site, there's a few specific things that we would like you to keep an eye out for and to provide feedback on:

* Bugs: nobody likes bugs, but they pop up anyway. If you spot something that looks out of place, or doesn't look right, or isn't working the way it should be, please let me know.

* Performance on various browsers and devices: we want to make sure that the site looks good and works well on as many devices as possible. Due to the way that we've built the site, it's actually really fast and performant, and should adapt well to devices of all screen sizes. But if you happen to load it up on, say, your five-year-old Android phone and it chokes, we want to know about it.

* Clarity of communication: we want to know if things aren't clear, or could be more concise, especially on pages like the about us page, as well as the Marketing section of the site like the call to action with the patriotic button, or the newsletter sign-up module in the footer. Please keep in mind that we are still in the process of editing and revising all of the site copy, so you may end up pointing out stuff that we already know needs work—that's okay, we want to hear it anyway.

* Missing pieces: are there things you're not seeing, that you'd like the site to include? In particular, we're interested in making sure that the About Us page is as comprehensive as possible, so if there's nothing your]d like to see added there, let us know.

How to send us feedback. I'm setting up a new channel in the Murder Friends Slack team for Fireside feedback. That will be the best way to document everything during this beta period.

Over the next couple of weeks, we'll be focusing on editing and revising the site copy, as well as migrating all of the previous issues over from the old site. As we do this, the changes will be reflected immediately on this beta site, but you can also peek into our progress by visiting the commits page of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firesidefiction/magazine/commits/master) for the site. For the more technically inclined among you, yes that's right: the entire Fireside site runs on a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and is served off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The idea is that, with a little bit of Markdown and Git knowledge, we can make Fireside production as simple as editing some plain text files in a folder, and making a push to [the Fireside git repository](https://github.com/firesidefiction/magazine "The Fireside Magazine repository on GitHub"). That means that if you want, you can log issues, submit pull requests, and otherwise keep track of our activity (but during the beta period, please stick to providing feedback in the Slack channel, not through GitHub Issues). I'll be writing much more about our technology stack and our new editorial and production workflow after we launch.

In the meantime, please help us kick some tires. We're pretty excited about this new site, and we can't wait to share it with the wider world. We are grateful that we have a wonderful group of friends to help us make sure that everything is up to snuff before we do so.
