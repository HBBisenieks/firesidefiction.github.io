### Description

Dale Gilooly has a problem. Well, Dale has a lot of problems. Addiction. Rent. A girlfriend he let slip away.

But Dale has a solution. It's a Box. And it will let him go back 10 minutes in time. Enough to fix his new mistakes as they happen. And give him an edge to fix the old ones that haunt him.

Oh, and one other problem: Where did these other Dales come from?

Walter Bard has a problem. Well, Walter has twenty problems. Each of them a body buried in a pumpkin patch. And... they're all the same. Down to the teeth.

But Walter has a solution. It's his job. Solutions. He's a detective, after all.

### Reviews
_Publishers Weekly_ praised _The Forever Endeavor_ for its "creative narrative and a sense for visceral action" and said "Wendig successfully busts the nicheâ€™s conventions wide open, and he throws in a few winking asides to his previous work that will evoke a grim chortle from his fans."
