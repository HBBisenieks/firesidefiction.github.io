This is the all-new beta site for Fireside Magazine. It runs on a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and is served off [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The idea is that, with a little bit of Markdown and Git knowledge, we can make Fireside production as simple as editing some plain text flies in a folder, and making a push to [the Fireside git repository](https://github.com/firesidefiction/magazine "The Fireside Magazine repository on GitHub").

You’ll find this post in the `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and push the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
