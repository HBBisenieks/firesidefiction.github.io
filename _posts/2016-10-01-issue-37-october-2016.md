Welcome to Issue 37! We’ve got three stories selected by guest editor Daniel José Older this month, all of them creepy in their own ways, in keeping with the Halloween spirit. We open with a wrenching little flash fiction piece, _Rabbit Heart_ by Alyssa Wong, about a person who rebuilds families one body at a time. Next is Cassanda Khaw’s _Speak_, a fierce look inside what passes for news these days, and what is really important.  (This one warmed my black little newsie heart.) And finally we have _The Get-Get Man_ by Melissa Moorer, a disturbing paranormal story that creeped me right the hell out.
Thanks as always for reading!
