## What the hell is Fireside?
Fireside Fiction Company started in 2012 as a Kickstarter-funded short-story magazine. We have two goals: to find and publish great stories regardless of genre, and to pay our writers and artists well. We’ve published dozens of writers since then, from well-known names to authors making their first sale. We put out three issues in 2012, and were able to shift to monthly issues in 2013.

## Fair pay for everyone
Fair pay is a big deal for us. We think creative people should be able to make a living from their work.

Fireside pays 12.5 cents per word, well above the 5 or 6 cents currently considered to be the minimum professional rate.

## Content Notes
Fireside Fiction Company provides content notes for books and stories to guide readers who may wish to seek out or avoid particular story elements. These content notes may contain spoilers.
Content notes are not the same as the ratings found on movies, TV shows, and video games. The intent is to help trauma survivors avoid being surprised by story elements that may trigger pain or emotional distress. So we don’t offer warnings about general violence, profanity, sex, or other things one sees in a movie rating.

We welcome suggestions for elements to include or exclude. You can email us at [books@firesidefiction.com](mailto:books@firesidefiction.com).

Here is a list of the elements we currently offer notes for:

- Alcohol Abuse

- Animal Abuse

- Child Abuse

- Child Death

- Domestic Violence

- Drug Abuse

- Emotional Abuse

- Gender-Bias Violence

- LGBTQ-Bias Violence

- Racial/Ethnic-Bias Violence

- Self-Harm

- Sexual Assault

- Suicide

- Torture

## The Fireside Team

### [Brian White](https://talkwordy.com)—Editor & Publisher
Brian White has been a newspaper journalist for over a decade, most of that in various copy-editing roles. He spends a lot of time on Twitter as [@talkwordy](https://twitter.com/talkwordy), where you can generally find him yelling about clowns, hedgehogs, or bigots. He lives around Boston with his amazing wife and two cats that are generally also amazing, though murderous.

### [Elsa Sjunneson-Henry](https://feministsonar.com)—Assistant Editor
Elsa Sjunneson-Henry is a half-blind, half-deaf, half- Scandinavian writer and editor from Seattle, Washington. She’s got an MA in Women’s History, and she uses that to write about disability and media. She’s enough of a nerd that she ended up making games writing a large part of her freelance career. You can find her yelling about disability and fiction in many places on the internet, including [Feminist Sonar](https://feministsonar.com/), her blog on the intersection of disability issues, gender, sexuality, and media. She’s the author of [_A Place Out of Time_](http://www.firesidefiction.com/issue34/chapter/a-place-out-of-time/) and is also included in the [_Ghost in the Cogs_](http://amzn.to/2au3fe0) anthology. Reports indicate she’s been called a dragon more than once. Supposedly that’s a good thing. Currently, she lives in New Jersey with her delightfully quirky husband, a hound dog, and two cats who may hate her. You can find Elsa on Twitter [@snarkbat](https://twitter.com/snarkbat).

### [Pablo Defendini](https://twitter.com/pablod)—Design & Technology Director
Pablo Defendini is [a designer for hire](https://defendini.com), with a focus on editorial design for digital media. Occasionally he'll do some illustration and printmaking for his own amusement. He also gets really nerdy exploring new forms for [building digital comics out of HTML and CSS](https://digitalcomics.co/). He helped launch [Tor.com](https://tor.com/), before moving on to work for companies that sit in the overlap between publishing and technology, like [Open Road Media](https://openroadmedia.com/) and [O'Reilly](https://safaribooksonline.com/). Pablo was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, lives in New York City, and works with clients all over the world.

## Submissions Guidelines

## Fireside is currently closed to submissions

Due to the high volume of submissions we received in September (over 1,100!) we are having to move back our goal to respond to all submissions, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 15. If you have not received a response after Nov. 15, query at brian@firesidefiction.com. Please do not query about your submission before then.
[Submit to Fireside](http://firesidefictioncompany.submittable.com/submit)

## General Guidelines
Fireside generally looks for for original, unpublished flash fiction (1,000 words or less) and original, unpublished short stories up to 4,000 words. We do not ever accept unsolicited submissions of art, novels, novellas, novelettes, or anything else longer than 4,000 words.

Please DO NOT resubmit stories that we have previously rejected by Fireside, even if you have revised them. They will be rejected unread.

Please do not submit a story that you have already submitted elsewhere but have not heard back from. (Often called simultaneous submission.)

A story that you have posted on your blog or website is considered published, please do not submit such stories.

We are not looking for poetry, nonfiction, reviews, art, or anything else but fiction.

### What We Are Looking For
Fireside’s goal is to publish great storytelling, regardless of genre. What do we mean by great storytelling? We want stories that go somewhere, with plot and a beginning, middle, and end. We’re not looking for character studies or metafiction or hallucinatory visions. (We LIKE those things; it’s just not what we publish in Fireside.)

I’ll let Neil Gaiman say it again, as I have in our Kickstarters. This is from his introduction to his “Stories” anthology, writing of his response to a question about what quote he would want inscribed on the wall of the kids’ section in a public library. He captured the reason why we love good stories in his response:
> I’m not sure I’d put a quote up, if it was me, and I had a library wall to deface. I think I’d just remind people of the power of stories, of why they exist in the first place. I’d put up the four words that anyone telling a story wants to hear. The ones that show it’s working, and that pages will be turned: “and then what happened?”

And yes, we seriously mean any genre. We have published sci-fi, horror, romance, crime, fantasy, Westerns, near-future, and modern non-speculative fiction. The stories were all terrific, and we are looking for more of those and from all the many genres we haven’t explored. Just tell us a good story.
Vague? A little. But we think it’s exciting, too. No two issues of Fireside have the same feel, and we hope that makes every issue a little more surprising.
If you’re not quite sure if your story fits, please send it and our editors can decide. If you want to get an idea of what we’re looking for, all of our issues are free to read online.

### Diversity
Fireside wants to reflect the endless array of diversity in the world. We welcome stories from all writers, and we are especially interested in stories including (but not limited to) the lives, experiences, and viewpoints of women, people of color, QUILTBAG people, people with disabilities, members of religious minorities, and people outside the United States. We strongly encourage submissions from people of those backgrounds, and all others whom traditional publishing has historically excluded.

### What We Don't want
There are some things we absolutely do not want. If you send us stories with these, the story will be rejected and you will be blacklisted:

- Depictions of rape or sexual assault

- Depictions of child molestation or brutalization of children

- Depictions of brutalization of women

- Depictions of brutalization of people with disabilities

- Depictions of graphic torture

- Depictions of animal abuse

This is not saying stories cannot touch on, address, or talk about these issues. But we don’t want these acts illustrated in detail in Fireside.

This isn’t negotiable, so don’t ask. If you need to have these things in your story, find a different market. We really do have a blacklist.

### What About Sex, Violence, and Profanity?
Sexual content is OK, but we are not a market for erotica. We are also fine with profanity and violence. We’re not looking for gratuitous violence, though.
